\f0\fs28 \cf2 In order to use cTiVo with your TiVo, you'll need what the TiVo calls a "Media Access Key". This number allows cTiVo access to your TiVo.\
Finding your key isn't difficult, but it helps to know where to look. Simply head to your TiVo main menu. From there you'll key down to "Messages & Settings". Here you'll find several selections but we're interested in "Account & System Information". Scroll down and press your OK key. On this menu you'll see a selection for "Media Access Key". That's it! You can now take down the key and use it for whatever pairing you might need to complete.\
